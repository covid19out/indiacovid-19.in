          <p>India reported its 1st case of COVID-19 on 30th January, 2020. It was a travel related case from Wuhan, China. Since then (as on 29th March, 2020), 979 confirmed cases and 25 deaths have been reported from 27 States/UTs. Although there is no evidence to widespread community transmission, 20 existing and 22 potential hotspots have been identified. The containment measures to break the cycle of transmission and clinical management of those affected would require large human resource (HR).</p>

            <li>These trainings will be designed to suit requirement of each and every section of healthcare worker involved in the containment operations.</li>
            <li>

            <li>For COVID-19 management, the district administration will pool-in the requisite human resources.</li>
            <li>Such pooled human resources would stay in the containment zone till the containment operations are over</li>
            <li>Isolation areas: in addition to training all hospital staff, dentists and AYUSH practitioners available should also be trained.</li>
            <li>Retired doctors and other healthcare professionals should be identified to work in noncovid areas in hospitals in case of emergencies</li>

            <li>Quarantine facilities: these are meant to house asymptomatic cases. The number identified and trained should be equal to the number of Covid Warriors.</li>
            <li>Ventilator use: at least two times the number of ICU beds earmarked for covid-19 patients should be imparted one day training.</li>
