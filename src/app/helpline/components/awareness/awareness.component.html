      <h6 class="mg-b-0 tx-spacing--1">Advisory on Social Distancing Measure in view of spread of COVID-19 disease</h6>
      <p>Social distancing is a non-pharmaceutical infection prevention and control intervention
      implemented to avoid/decrease contact between those who are infected with a disease causing
      pathogen and those who are not, so as to stop or slow down the rate and extent of disease
      transmission in a community. This eventually leads to decrease in spread, morbidity and
      mortality due to the disease.</p>
      <p>In addition to the proposed interventions, the State/UT Governments may prescribe such other measures as they consider necessary.</p>
      <p>All these proposed interventions shall be in force till 31st of March, 2020. They will be reviewed as per the evolving situation.</p>
      <p class="font-weight-bold">The following interventions are proposed:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Closure of all educational establishments (schools, universities etc), gyms, museums, cultural and social centres, swimming pools and theatres. Students should be advised to stay at home. Online education to be promoted.</li>
        <li>Possibility of postponing exams may be explored. Ongoing exams to be conducted only after ensuring physical distance of one meter amongst students.</li>
        <li>Encourage private sector organizations/employers to allow employees to work from home wherever feasible.</li>
        <li>Meetings, as far as feasible, shall be done through video conferences. Minimize or reschedule meetings involving large number of people unless necessary.</li>
        <li>Restaurants to ensure handwashing protocol and proper cleanliness of frequently touched surfaces. Ensure physical distancing (minimum 1metre) between tables; encourage open air seating where practical with adequate distancing.</li>
        <li>Keep already planned weddings to a limited gathering, postpone all non-essential social and cultural gatherings.</li>
        <li>Local authorities to have a dialogue with organizers of sporting events and competitions involving large gatherings and they may be advised to postpone such events.</li>
        <li>Local authorities to have a dialogue with opinion leaders and religious leaders to regulate mass gatherings and should ensure no overcrowding/at least one metre distance between people.</li>
        <li>Local authorities to have meeting with traders associations and other stakeholders to regulate hours, exhibit Do’s and Don’ts and take up a communication drive in market places like sabzi mandi, anaj mandi, bus depots, railway stations, post-offices etc., where essential services are provided.</li>
        <li>All commercial activities must keep a distance of one meter between customers. Measures to reduce peak hour crowding in markets.</li>
        <li>Non-essential travel should be avoided. Buses, Trains and aeroplanes to maximize social distancing in public transport besides ensuring regular and proper disinfection of surfaces.</li>
        <li>Hospitals to follow necessary protocol related with COVID-19 management as prescribed and restrict family/friends/children visiting patients in hospitals.</li>

      <h6 class="mg-b-0 tx-spacing--1">COVID-19: GUIDELINES ON DEAD BODY MANAGEMENT</h6>
      <div class="mb-2">
        <p class="font-weight-bold">1. Scope of the document</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There are currently over 100 laboratory confirmed cases and two deaths due to Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in India. Being a new disease there is knowledge gap on how to dispose of dead body of a suspect or confirmed case of COVID-19.</li>
          <li>This guideline is based on the current epidemiological knowledge about the COVID-19. India is currently having travel related cases and few cases of local transmission. At this stage, all suspect/ confirmed cases will be isolated in a health care facility. Hence the document is limited in scope to hospital deaths.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-2">
        <p class="font-weight-bold">2. Key Facts</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The main driver of transmission of COVID-19 is through droplets. There is unlikely to be an increased risk of COVID infection from a dead body to health workers or family members who follow standard precautions while handling body.</li>
          <li>Only the lungs of dead COVID patients, if handled during an autopsy, can be infectious.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-2">
        <p class="font-weight-bold">3. Standard Precautions to be followed by health care workers while handling dead bodies of COVID.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Hand hygiene.</li>
          <li>Use of personal protective equipment (e.g., water resistant apron, gloves, masks, eyewear).</li>
